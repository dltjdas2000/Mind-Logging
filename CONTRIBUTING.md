## Branching Strategy
Our branching strategy is as follows:

- main branch: This branch contains stable, production-ready code.
- dev branch: All development takes place in the dev branch. Features and bug fixes should be merged here before going to main.
- Feature branches: For each feature or bug fix, create a new branch off dev with a descriptive name, such as feature/new-login or bugfix/fix-auth.

## Coding Standards
We follow these coding conventions:

- Code Style: Please follow the Google Python Style Guide.
- Linting: Ensure code passes all linting checks before submitting.
- Testing: Write tests for all new code to ensure stability. We use [test(yourID)_filename] for unit tests.
- Comments: Use comments where necessary to explain complex logic, but aim to write self-explanatory code.

## Submitting Changes
 - Pull Request (PR): When your feature or bug fix is ready, submit a pull request to the dev branch. Provide a clear description of the changes and link to the relevant issue if applicable.
 - Review: PRs will be reviewed by maintainers. Please be responsive to feedback and make necessary changes.
 - Testing: Ensure all tests pass locally before submitting. PRs must pass all tests to be merged.

## Issue Tracking

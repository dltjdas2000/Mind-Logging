# **Mind-Logging**

Mind Logging uses AI to help keep a diary and manage stress. It aims to help users reflect on their emotions, reduce stress, and make journaling a habit. To compensate for the limitations of current diary apps, AI-based tools are integrated to provide users with new experiences in writing and stress management.

**About the Project**
=======================

Mind Logging uses AI to help keep a diary and manage stress. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Modern people try to keep a diary for organizing their emotions and thoughts and relieving stress, but they struggle to figure out what to write every day. Existing diary applications have limited support for emotional expression and stress management and lack the ability to help them write a diary, so we focus on them. 

Our diary aims to help users *reflect on their emotions, reduce stress, and make journaling a habit*. **AI-based tools** are integrated to provide users with new experiences in writing and stress management. Moreover, additional functions for stress management will help users express their feelings and systematically identify and resolve the causes of stress.

It is crucial for anyone experiencing stress to manage its mental triggers. Failing to do so could lead to loss of confidence, self-identity, and even stress-related health problems. So, the core goal of our project is to help users gain a deeper understanding of themselves and build a habit of regular journaling. 

Accordingly, our target audience consists of individuals seeking stress management, and our project aims to help them take control of their mental well-being by writing diaries with AI and releasing negative emotions through conversation. This process is designed to help people manage their stress and take control of their thoughts.
